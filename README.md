# MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT FRAMEWORK
`by Nathan Lauga`
*****

**[BUILD IN PROGRESS - January, 7th 2020]**

This repository main goal is to provide a template when starting a Machine Learning project. It allows Data Scientist to have a better understanding of his project and it also help future developers to get a good sense about the project life.

Each directory has a main goal so that you'll be able to retrieve what you wanted to do. 

Here the key is to **create code human readable and not to long**, so try to create a notebook for a specific function (in the end you do as you wish each developer has his own habbits ;) ).

**If you want to get some example about how to use this solution please refer to this repository : [NOT AVAIBLE FOR THE MOMENT] [Machine Learning project structure - Example](#).**

## HOW TO START A PROJECT

First clone or download this repo to start from scratch : 
```
git clone https://github.com/Nathanlauga/machine-learning-project-framework
```

When you start a project be sure that you understand his context (who needs this AI, what do you need to do, why you need to do it, etc.) and start to think about what data you'll need to collect.

So what you need before even write a single line of code, please use the Machine Learning Canvas on the `00-START` directory. You can find different format, choose the format that suits you. For more information about this document, you'll find details on its original source : [Machine Learning Canvas -- Louis DORARD](https://www.louisdorard.com/machine-learning-canvas).
